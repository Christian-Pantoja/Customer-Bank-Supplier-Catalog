# Customer-Bank-Supplier-Catalog
Developed a program user interface for a store/bank/supplier that uses file-based-storage to allow users to sign up/log in to a store to select items from the inventory. Once at checkout, the user must enter their payment information which is saved in a file and pay for their selected items. The bank system is then triggered when the user submits the payment, for the bank checks if the user has sufficient funds (using stored card information) with a buffer to read the scripts and finally calls for a response once they are read. If the response is successful, the user receives a confirmation number (the transaction is saved) and the stock of the store is updated, which then the supplier can also log in to the store UI and can restock the items purchased; however, if unsuccessful the user receives and error for either insufficient funds, expired credit card, or incorrect card information.
